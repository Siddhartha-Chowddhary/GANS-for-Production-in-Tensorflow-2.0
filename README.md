# GANS-for-Production-in-Tensorflow-2.0
#UnZip Models and Numpy_File_Data  if you want to use it for experiment porposes or else go on with your on Data and Models 

#Numpy_File_Data Folder :-
Contains Numpy array data file of Sports Car images you can make your own Numpy File using Data_Loader.ipynb

#Models Folder :-
Contains Trained Model which is trained on Sports car images you can create your own in verison Tensorflow 1.14 and use that model for Production 

#Notebooks Folder :-
Contains Data_Loader.ipynb & GANS_Model_v2.ipynb

#How to use GANS_Model_v2.ipynb for Production ?

1. Load the Trained Model 
2. Change EPOCHS = 10000, 60000 ... ===> EPOCHS = 1 
3. It will the very first trained Epoch as production output
